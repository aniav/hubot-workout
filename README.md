Hubot workout
======

This is a workout bot designed to keep you moving a bit at work.
The main idea is to randomly pick people from your team and force them to do a
few push-ups or wall-sits (yes, I also didn't know what this is to begin with).

Functionality
------

Currently implemented
* starting/stoping the bot by writing to him on a channel
* drawing users from a channel he has been started on (choosing only from active, full members will)
* saving statistics of workouts for specific channels

History
-------
The project was initially inspired by the great idea behind [slackbot-workout](https://github.com/brandonshin/slackbot-workout) and some of the main concepts are still the same.
